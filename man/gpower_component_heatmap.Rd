\title{Plots value of each column of the data for each component}
\usage{
gpower_component_heatmap(
  data,
  k,
  rho,
  penalty = "l1",
  center = TRUE,
  block = FALSE,
  mu = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Input matrix of size (p x n) with p < n.}

\item{k}{Number of components, 0 < k < p.}

\item{rho}{Relative sparsity weight factor of the optimization. Either a
vector of floats of size k or float which will be repeated k times. 0 < rho
< 1.}

\item{penalty}{Penalty type to use in the optimization. Either 'l0' or 'l1'.
The default is 'l1' since it performed best in experiments.}

\item{center}{Centers the data. Either TRUE or FALSE. Default is TRUE.}

\item{block}{Optimization method. If FALSE, the components are calculated
individually. If TRUE, all components are calculated at the same time.
Default is FALSE.}

\item{mu}{Mean to be applied to each component in the block. Either a vector
of float of size k or a float which will be repeated k times. Only used if
block is TRUE. Default is FALSE.}
}
\description{
This plot shows the values of the components, connected to the columns of the
original data. The column data is ordered using builtin dendrogram of the
base heatmap function.
